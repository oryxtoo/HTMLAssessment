    <strong>"One</strong> good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain." - Bob Marley
    <br>
    <p><strong>“When</strong> I was alive, I believed — as you do — that time was at least as real and solid
    as myself, and probably more so. I said 'one o'clock' as though I could see it, and 'Monday' as though
    I could find it on the map; and I let myself be hurried along from minute to minute, day to day, year
    to year, as though I were actually moving from one place to another. Like everyone else, I lived in a
    house bricked up with seconds and minutes, weekends and New Year's Days, and I never went outside until
    I died, because there was no other door. Now I know that I could have walked through the walls. (...)
    You can strike your own time, and start the count anywhere. When you understand that — then any time
    at all will be the right time for you.”</p>
<p><em>―<strong>Peter S. Beagle</strong>, The Last Unicorn</em></p>
    <br>
    <p align="center"><em><strong>“You</strong> were the one who taught me," he said. "I never looked at you without seeing the sweetness of the way the world goes together, or without sorrow for its spoiling. I became a hero to serve you, and all that is like you.”
    ― <strong>Peter S. Beagle</strong>, The Last Unicorn</em></p>
    <br>
<p><strong>“The</strong> true secret in being a hero lies in knowing the order of things.
      The swineherd cannot already be wed to the princess when he embarks on his adventures,
      nor can the boy knock on the witch's door when she is already away on vacation. The wicked uncle
      cannot be found out and foiled before he does something wicked. Things must happen when it is
      time for them to happen. Quests may not simply be abandoned; prophecies may not be left to rot
      like unpicked fruit; unicorns may go unrescued for a very long time, but not forever.
      The happy ending cannot come in the middle of the story.”</p>
<p><em>-<strong>Peter S. Beagle</strong>, The Last Unicorn</em></p>
    <br>
<p><strong>“I think</strong> love is stronger than habits or circumstances. I think it is
      possible to keep yourself for someone for a long time and still remember why you were
      waiting when she comes at last.”</p>
<p><em>―<strong>Peter S. Beagle</strong>, The Last Unicorn</em></p>
